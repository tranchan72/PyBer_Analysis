## Background and Results
  Create a visualization for ride-sharing fare in cities which are grouped by types: Rural, Urban, Suburban. 
### Purpose
  This multiple-line graph is to show a trend of total fares by month among 3 cities' types 
### Technical Analysis
  Sum of fares of all cities by types
### Results
  ! (Fig%Challenge.png)

### Summary
  The chart shows clearly that total fares in urban cities are much greater than in rural cities. There is no significant differences in total fares by month.

## Challenges Encountered and Overcome
  Challenges mostly are to create a DataFrame with columns and Index in one place. 
  Group data by DateTime/Week is challenging.
  I googled a lot.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* Programming: Some are not covered in Module. A lot of Google-fu has been used

* Data analysis

* Graphing, etc: import matplotlib.dates as mdates is not covered. It took a lot of time to format ticks by month.
